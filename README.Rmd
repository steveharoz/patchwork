The goal of `patchwork` is to make it ridiculously simple to combine separate
ggplots into the same graphic. As such it tries to solve the same problem as
`gridExtra::grid.arrange()` and `cowplot::plot_grid` but using an API that 
incites exploration and iteration.

## Installation

You can install patchwork from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("thomasp85/patchwork")
```

## Example

The usage of `patchwork` is simple: just add plots together!

```{r example}
library(ggplot2)
library(patchwork)

p1 <- ggplot(mtcars) + geom_point(aes(mpg, disp))
p2 <- ggplot(mtcars) + geom_boxplot(aes(gear, disp, group = gear))

p1 + p2
```

you are of course free to also add the plots together as part of the same 
plotting operation:

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars) +
  geom_point(aes(mpg, disp)) +
  ggplot(mtcars) + 
  geom_boxplot(aes(gear, disp, group = gear))
```

layouts can be specified by adding a `plot_layout()` call to the assemble. This
lets you define the dimensions of the grid and how much space to allocate to the
different rows and columns

```{r}
p1 + p2 + plot_layout(ncol = 1, heights = c(3, 1))
```

If you need to add a bit of space between your plots you can use `plot_spacer()`
to fill a cell in the grid with nothing

```{r}
p1 + plot_spacer() + p2
```

You can make nested plots layout by wrapping part of the plots in parentheses - 
in these cases the layout is scoped to the different nesting levels

```{r}
p3 <- ggplot(mtcars) + geom_smooth(aes(disp, qsec))
p4 <- ggplot(mtcars) + geom_bar(aes(carb))

p4 + {
  p1 + {
    p2 +
      p3 +
      plot_layout(ncol = 1)
  }
} +
  plot_layout(ncol = 1)
```

### Advanced features
In addition to adding plots and layouts together, `patchwork` defines some other
operators that might be of interest. `-` will behave like `+` but put the left
and right side in the same nesting level (as opposed to putting the right side 
into the left sides nesting level). Observe:

```{r}
p1 + p2 + p3 + plot_layout(ncol = 1)
```

this is basically the same as without braces (just like standard math 
arithmetic) - the plots are added sequentially to the same nesting level. Now 
look:

```{r}
p1 + p2 - p3 + plot_layout(ncol = 1)
```

Now `p1 + p2` and `p3` is on the same level...

> A note on semantics. If `-` is read as *subtract* its use makes little sense 
as we are not removing plots. Think of it as a hyphen instead...

Often you are interested in just putting plots besides or on top of each other.
`patchwork` provides both `|` and `/` for horizontal and vertical layouts 
respectively. They can of course be combined for a very readable layout syntax:

```{r}
(p1 | p2 | p3) /
      p4
```

There are two additional operators that are used for a slightly different 
purpose, namely to reduce code repetition. Consider the case where you want to
change the theme for all plots in an assemble. Instead of modifying all plots
individually you can use `&` or `*` to add elements to all subplots. The two
differ in that `*` will only affect the plots on the current nesting level:

```{r}
(p1 + (p2 + p3) + p4 + plot_layout(ncol = 1)) * theme_bw()
```

whereas `&` will recurse into nested levels:

```{r}
p1 + (p2 + p3) + p4 + plot_layout(ncol = 1) & theme_bw()
```

> Note that parenthesis is required in the former case due to higher precedence
of the `*` operator. The latter case is the most common so it has deserved the 
easiest use.

### Global theme options

You can also adjust the aesthetics of the overall image via the `plot_theme()` function.

Modify the background color:
```{r}
borderless_theme <- theme_bw() + theme(panel.border = element_blank())
p1 <- ggplot(mtcars) + geom_point(aes(mpg, disp)) + borderless_theme
p2 <- ggplot(mtcars) + geom_boxplot(aes(gear, disp, group = gear)) + borderless_theme

p1 + p2 + plot_theme(background = "gray92")
```

You can also add a border around the image and padding to each side:
```{r}
p1 + p2 + plot_theme(
  background = "gray92", 
  border_color = "black", 
  border_thickness = 10, 
  padding = unit(c(1, 1, 5, 1), "cm"))
```

----------

This is all it does for now, but stay tuned as more functionality is added, such
as collapsing guides, etc...
